A Netflix-like Clone website which display a list of movies and it is made by using HTML and CSS for the design and frameworks, JavaScript and React.js for implementing the dynamic stuff.
Although, it needs node.js runtime because, the browser doesnt load the react scripts directly and this repo could be further updated and i would try to develop this site better maybe in future or if you could do so, just fork or clone it, and pull. 

Requirements:
-------------
You need node.js in order to view this website as it just load the scripts which has already built by node modules.
After installing node.js, Just type those commands i say in the VSCode terminal 
**npm install** to install the necessary dependencies to construct the scripts
Then, type **npm start** which actually compiles the webpack and creates a localhost server and hosts it.
After this, it automatically load the webpage by the node server.
