-----------
A Netflix-like Clone website which display a list of movies and it is made by using HTML and CSS for the design and frameworks, JavaScript and React.js for implementing the dynamic stuff. This repo could be updated and i would try to develop this site better maybe in future or if you could do, just fork or clone it, and pull.
